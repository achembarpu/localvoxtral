// swift-tools-version: 6.1
import PackageDescription

// Standalone package (like PolishHelper) so the main app's `swift build` / `swift test`
// loop never compiles mlx-swift's C++/Metal core. The shippable helper is built with
// xcodebuild by scripts/package_app.sh; a plain `swift build` of this package compiles
// but produces a binary that cannot load Metal kernels at runtime — fine for the
// Metal-free unit tests (SpeechEngineTextTests), which is what CI's tier-0 lane runs here.
//
// SpeechEngine consumes Blaizzy/mlx-audio-swift's VoxtralRealtime engine as an upstream
// dependency (product `MLXAudioSTT`), pinned to a reviewed revision — see DEPENDENCY.md.
// The float32-leak fixes we previously carried as local patches were upstreamed in
// Blaizzy/mlx-audio-swift#226. Only the append-only delta contract stays local, now in
// our own SpeechEngineText layer (TranscriptDeltaEmitter). Replaces the managed Python
// voxmlx backend.
